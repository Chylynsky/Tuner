# Tuner-UWP

Guitar tuner for Universal Windows Platform, created using C++/WinRT and FFTW3 library.

Solution consists of two main parts:
- DSP project with utilities allowing window and FIR filter generation
- Tuner project with GUI tuner application

## Notes

- During the first app launch, loading may take a while. This is due to the FFTW best peformant algorithm calculation. The result of
	these calculations is saved locally and loaded in the next app launches.
- Pitch detection is performed using a Harmonic Product Spectrum algorithm.
- When *CREATE_MATLAB_PLOTS* macro is defined in *PitchAnalyzer.h*, *filter_log.m* and *analysis_log.m* Matlab files are generated
	to application's *LocalState* directory allowing further inspection.
- Best way to find these files is to search for them in *C:\Users\username\AppData* (AppData is a hidden folder)
- *Tuner* project's compilation is dependant on *DSP* project.
